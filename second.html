    <p class="introp"> I am excited about starting this program and look forward to sharpening my skills.  The world is becoming increasingly connected and I would like to be more directly involved in this process.  I'm looking forward to being part of a team and implementing ideas collaboratively.  I'm not sure what specifically I want to do after graduation and hope to get a better idea of that during this course.   As long as I am continuing to challenge myself and develop my skills I think I would be happy working for a wide variety of companies.
